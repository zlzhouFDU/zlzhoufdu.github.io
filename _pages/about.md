I am a junior student in the School of Data Science, Fudan University. I am interested in Robustness, Reinforcement Learning and Optimization in Machine Learning. I am advised by [Yanwei Fu](https://markdown.com.cn), [Xinwei Sun](https://sunxinwei0625.github.io/sunxw.github.io/) and [Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/).
